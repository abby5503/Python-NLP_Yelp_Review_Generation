# Python-NLP_Yelp_Review_Generation

In this project, I tried two methods to generate the review 
-> LSTM with Keras and GPT2 with HuggingFace

Here is the result from LSTM
- "We had a company dinner at rosewood and it could not have been a better experience . Location from our hotel downtown was easily accessible on scooters as well as uber , the activities available on the grass as our large group arrived was a huge plus and the staff was kind and accommodating to each and charge us promptly"
- "Absolutely amazing french food , never disappointing . We started with escargot and oysters beautiful way to get the appetite going , with some fresh bread and a cocktail . Our server was friendly , courteous and knowledgeable"

Here is the result from GPT2
- "We just walked into the neighborhood and we were pleasantly surprised by the amazing service, delicious food, and the most attentive and warm welcome ever. They were busy on a saturday night but it was bustling due to outdoor seating, so it was a wonderful surprise to have a delicious meal out here! Will be returning and would love to have the stuffed lobster again."
- "My family and I love this place, our family and all my best friends are here. We have several different type of dim sum places in atlanta and this is by far the best we have found in any quality restaurant. Weve tried just about everything on the dim sum menu and have been very impressed, not only is the food delicious but the staff is friendly and the service is incredible."
